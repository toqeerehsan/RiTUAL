- title: "Why shot noise does not generally detect pairing in mesoscopic superconducting tunnel junctions"
  abs: Can mesoscopic shot noise experiments show the doubling of the charge carriers in a superconductor? Turns out, it's complicated. We investigated this in several different samples, and made predictions as to what is necessary to make this work.
